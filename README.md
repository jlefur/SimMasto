A Simulation Model for Integrating Multidisciplinary Knowledge in Natural Sciences. Application to Wild Rodent Studies.

This model aims to develop, using basic object-oriented paradigms, and in collaboration with biologists, a comprehensive synthetic ecology about a given application domain: wild rodentsâ€™ population dynamics. see http://lefur.jean.free.fr/1jean/publications/2021-LeFur_BioInspiration_Simultech2021.pdf

This is a Repast-Simphony/Eclipse distribution It proposes simulation of eight case studies concerning wild rodents at different scales
